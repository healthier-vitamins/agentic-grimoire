# AI tells

Excerpted from [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) v3.0.0 SKILL.md (MIT, notice at the end), which draws on Wikipedia's ["Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing). Kept: the reasoning, each pattern's *Watch for* and *Problem* lines, and when not to act. Dropped: the before/after examples and the rewrite procedure.

## Why AI text sounds the way it does

A language model writes whatever is most likely to come next, so by default it makes the choice that fits the widest range of readers and subjects. A human writer chooses for one reader and one subject, so their choices are uneven and specific. Every pattern below is one form of the default choice:

- **Staging.** The sentence signals importance instead of adding a fact, with a contrast that only adds weight or a one-line closer that repeats the point.
- **Rhythm by rule.** Triads and dashes applied everywhere, whether or not the meaning asks for them.
- **Inflation.** Ordinary facts dressed as pivotal or expert-backed.
- **Formatting by rule.** Bold and title case applied to every item.
- **Leftovers.** Chat wrappers and drafting moves that were never meant for the reader.

Word habits change with every model release. The structural habits above persist, so they lead the list below.

Two rules follow from this. Every sentence you keep must add something the reader did not already have. A tell counts in proportion to how rarely a careful writer would make it on purpose. The patterns are numbered strongest first: §1 to §5 justify an edit on one sighting, and a pattern marked *weak alone* needs company from other tells in the same passage before you act.

## A. Staging instead of stating

These are the strongest and most frequent tells in current model prose. Act on one sighting.

### 1. Not X but Y

**Watch for:** not X but Y; not just, not only, or not merely X, but Y; it's not X, it's Y; the reversed form X rather than Y; the same contrast split across sentences ("This does not mean X. It means Y."); a clipped negative tail ("..., no guessing"). The formula appears in every language; treat the equivalent construction the same way.  
**Problem:** The negative half names something no one claimed, so the positive half sounds larger. It adds weight without adding a claim. State the point directly. Keep a contrast only when the negative half corrects a belief the reader actually holds, or when both halves carry information.

### 2. One-line closers and dramatic fragments

**Watch for:** a one-sentence paragraph that restates the paragraph before it; "That is the real win."; "Read that again."; "Let that sink in."; the same closer after several sections; a row of fragments ("No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia."); one word in ALL CAPS or with periods between words (every. single. day.).  
**Problem:** The line asks the reader to pause on a claim instead of adding to it. One short sentence can carry emphasis when it carries a new fact. Cut a closer that repeats. Merge a row of fragments into a sentence with a specific claim.

### 3. Sayings that sound deep

**Watch for:** the real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter, X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of  
**Problem:** An ordinary point is dressed as a hidden truth or an aphorism, and the dressing adds no detail. Replace the saying with the specific claim.

### 4. Staged run-up before the point

**Watch for:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, and casual versions such as "one thing that bit me, so pay attention"  
**Problem:** The writer announces the point or stages a moment of candor instead of making the point. Remove the run-up, not just its tone. "Honestly" or "look" inside a casual sentence is ordinary; the tell is the standalone opener before a routine claim.

### 5. Arguing with no one

**Watch for:** This isn't (mainly) about, I'm not saying, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, Some might say... but, A tempting approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just  
**Problem:** The text answers an objection or rejects an option that appears nowhere else, usually a leftover from an earlier draft. Remove the defense; if it holds a real claim, state the claim. Keep an objection the text attributes or answers in full, and keep an option a reader would actually weigh. Several unrelated rejections in a row are a stronger sign than one.

## B. Rhythm by rule

A person may do any one of these on purpose, so the weaker ones need company from other tells.

### 6. Forced triads

**Problem:** Ideas arrive in threes to sound complete, whether the meaning has three parts or not. The tell can be one sentence ("innovation, inspiration, and insights"), three parallel examples, or three short facts followed by a lesson. Check that each item adds a distinct idea. Merge examples, develop the strongest one, or vary the structure when they do not. Keep three real items when the meaning needs three.

### 7. Repeated sentence openings

**Problem:** Several sentences in a row start with the same subject, often *she* or *he*, because repetition is handled by rule instead of by ear. Merge the sentences, change the subject, or begin with the action. Do not ban the repeated word; a remaining sentence may still start with "She." Writers also repeat an opening on purpose for rhythm, as in "She came. She saw. She conquered."

### 8. Dashes as the universal connector

**Rule:** The final rewrite must not contain em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) unless the writer's sample uses them; then match the sample's rate. Replace each dash with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or rewrite the sentence. This includes spaced dashes and double hyphens (` -- `) used as dashes. Leave dashes and hyphens inside code blocks, inline code, commands, paths, and URLs alone.
**Problem:** A dash lets the writer skip choosing how two clauses relate, so a model reaches for it everywhere. Many editors and journalists also use dashes, so one dash is *weak alone*; a text full of them is not.

### 9. Stacked qualifiers

**Watch for:** to be fair, it's also possible, could potentially, might arguably, in some cases it may, this is an inference  
**Problem:** Repeated editing adds one qualifier after another until every claim sounds uncertain, usually to repair an earlier overstatement rather than to report real doubt. Keep a qualifier only when the source supports it and the meaning needs it. Keep scope statements, legal and safety notices, and real corrections. Ordinary hedges such as *perhaps* or *tends to* are human habits and not tells. *Weak alone.*

### 10. Hyphenated pairs everywhere

**Watch for:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end  
**Problem:** These pairs are hyphenated in every position. Keep the hyphen before a noun when grammar needs it, as in `a high-quality report`, and drop it after the noun, as in `the report is high quality`. *Weak alone.*

### 11. Passive voice and missing subjects

**Problem:** The text hides who acts or drops the subject. Use active voice when it makes the actor and action clearer. *Weak alone.*

## C. Inflation and borrowed authority

The fact underneath is usually sound. Keep it and remove the dressing.

### 12. Overused AI words

**Watch for:** Actually, additionally, align with, bolstered, crucial, deep dive, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, gate/gated/gating (figurative; keep technical uses), highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), meticulous/meticulously, pivotal, quietly, robust (figurative; keep technical uses), showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant  
**Problem:** Models use these words far more often than people do, especially in groups. This is the only vocabulary list in the skill. A formal word outside it is not a tell by itself.

### 13. Inflated significance

**Watch for:** stands as a testament, a pivotal or crucial moment, plays a key role, marking or shaping the, underscores its importance, reflects a broader, enduring or lasting legacy, setting the stage for, evolving landscape, indelible mark; Despite these challenges... continues to thrive, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook, Awards and recognition; the future looks bright, exciting times ahead, a step in the right direction  
**Problem:** An ordinary detail is said to mark a change, prove a legacy, or promise a future. The move appears at three scales: a phrase, a stock "challenges and outlook" section, and a send-off paragraph. Keep the fact and drop the significance. End on the last concrete fact; if the source states real plans, use those.

### 14. Vague connection or association

**Watch for:** associated with, in association with, connected to, in connection with, linked to, tied to  
**Problem:** The text says two things are connected without saying how. "He was associated with the leadership of ExampleCorp" hides whether he was the CEO, a board member, or a consultant. Name the relationship the source gives. If the source does not say, keep the vague wording rather than inventing a role.

### 15. Shallow -ing riders

**Watch for:** highlighting, underscoring, emphasizing, ensuring, reflecting, symbolizing, contributing to, cultivating, fostering, encompassing, showcasing  
**Problem:** An -ing phrase is bolted onto a simple fact to make it sound deeper. Attaching it to a named source ("Roger Ebert highlighted the lasting influence") does not make it true. Keep the fact; keep the rider only when the source supports what it claims.

### 16. Sales language

**Watch for:** boasts, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, featuring, diverse array, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning  
**Problem:** The text reads like an advertisement, especially for places, culture, products, or organizations. State what the thing is.

### 17. Borrowed authority

**Watch for:** experts argue, observers have cited, industry reports, some critics, several publications; cited, featured, or profiled in [a list of outlets], trade publications, independent coverage; active social media presence, over N followers  
**Problem:** A name or an unnamed authority stands in for what was said. Unnamed experts prop up a claim; a list of prestige outlets props up a person. When the source text names the real source and what it said, use that. Otherwise cut the unsupported claim or the list. Never invent a source. A missing citation alone is not a tell; most writing is unsourced.

### 18. Avoiding is, are, and has

**Watch for:** serves as, stands as, functions as, operates as, marks, represents [a]; boasts, features, offers, maintains [a]; refers to  
**Problem:** Simple verbs are replaced with longer phrases. Use *is*, *are*, and *has*.

## D. Formatting by rule

Templates and visual editors also produce clean formatting. The tell is decoration on every item.

### 19. Bold as decoration

**Problem:** Words are bolded without a reason, and vertical lists give every item a bold label and a colon. Remove the bold. Turn a labeled list into prose when the labels carry no information of their own.

### 20. Decorative headings

**Problem:** Headings capitalize every main word, and headings or list items carry emojis or arrows (→) as decoration. A horizontal rule sits between every section, or the document opens with a top-level heading that repeats its own title. Use sentence case, remove the decoration and the rules, and let the title stand once.

### 21. Curly quotation marks

**Problem:** Curly quotes (“...”) appear where the writer or target format uses straight quotes ("..."). Most editors auto-curl, so this is *weak alone*.

## E. Leftovers from the chat and the draft

Remove these outright. Nothing here needs rewriting.

### 22. Chatbot residue

**Watch for:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, Great question!, You're absolutely right, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...  
**Problem:** A chatbot's greeting, praise, offer, or closing remains in text that should stand on its own. It is the most certain tell in this list and the easiest to miss when it wraps real content. Remove the wrapper and keep the content.

### 23. Knowledge-limit disclaimers and guesses

**Watch for:** as of [date], up to my last training update, while specific details are limited, based on available information, not publicly available, not widely documented or disclosed, in the provided or available sources, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, likely [grew up, studied, began], it is believed that  
**Problem:** The text mentions where the model's knowledge ends, or admits it found no source and then fills the gap with a plausible guess. State what the source does not show, or remove the sentence. Never present a guess as a fact.

### 24. A heading repeated in the first sentence

**Problem:** A heading is followed by a one-line paragraph that restates it before the real content begins. Remove the repeated sentence.

### 25. Writing about the previous version

**Problem:** Documentation and comments describe what the text replaced instead of the current behavior. Mention the previous version only in change logs, release notes, migration guides, and other documents about change.

## When not to act

Each pattern describes a default choice, and a person can make any one of them on purpose. Act on a *weak alone* tell only when several tells share a passage. Leave a watched phrase alone inside a quotation, a title, a proper name, or a passage that discusses the phrase rather than uses it. Salutations and sign-offs on a letter or comment predate chatbots. Text written before November 30, 2022 is not AI-written. People who judge by feel do little better than chance, and human writing keeps absorbing AI habits. Several tells together are the safeguard.

Keep the details that carry the writer's voice unless they hurt the meaning:

- A specific, unusual detail: a real address, an odd quote, "the lawyer who used to work upstairs from my dentist."
- Mixed feelings and unresolved tension: "I think this is mostly good, but it bothers me, and I can't fully explain why."
- Dated, era-bound references: slang, memes, and in-jokes that map to a specific year and subculture.
- A first-person choice the writer can explain.
- A genuine aside, parenthetical, or self-correction: "(I keep wanting to say 'almost' here, but it really was certain.)"
